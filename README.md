## solving the N-queen problem using gentic search algorithms.

initial state is randomly generated, then using the succssor function we try to reach the solution using BFS, DFS, GREEDY and A*.
when you run `main.py` you have 2 options, 
one you can use the program to solve N-queen problem using any of the algorithms listed above. 
Two you can Find the average of three runnig times for each algorithm for N queens in a bar chart Form.
